This is a small game project to solidify and test some netcode stuff before I
start implementing netcode on my larger game project (prototype 1 in my MEMO67
engine).


Initial idea as of 20250705 is:
  -Naive TCP login.
  -UDP game connections.
  -Slitherio-like game where square players eat world-spawned food.
  -Server will handle world state, players can be authoritative over their
  position and attempts to eat food.
